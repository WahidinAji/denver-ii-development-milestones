I WANT TO CREATE A WEB APPLICATION THAT HELPS PARENTS TRACK THEIR CHILD'S DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES. THE APPLICATION SHOULD ALLOW PARENTS TO INPUT THEIR CHILD'S AGE AND SEE WHICH MILESTONES THEY HAVE REACHED. IT SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT AND HOW TO SUPPORT THEIR CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT. THE APPLICATION SHOULD BE USER-FRIENDLY AND EASY TO NAVIGATE, WITH CLEAR VISUALS AND INTERACTIVE FEATURES. PARENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE THEIR PROGRESS WITH THEIR CHILD'S DOCTOR AND OTHER CAREGIVERS. THE APPLICATION SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE ON ALL DEVICES AND PLATFORMS, INCLUDING MOBILE AND TABLET.
